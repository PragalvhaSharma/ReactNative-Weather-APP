To create a more dynamic experience
- State is an object that contains information about a component that we want to track
- In the object, we use key-value pairs
- Visualization
    - Using props we passed data into each of the rooms
    - But with state we can track values within the room and modfy the house based on its status
        E.g -- if its messy, clean do this
            - But when the state changes the whole component re-renders
            - PURPOSE is to trigger UI updates based on the changes 

Summary
    - Props: Lets us pass data between components
    - State: Helps us internally mange data within our components 
        -REDUX can be used to manage states 

UseEffect 
    - SideEffect - Something not inside react within our components such as using timers, datafetching, subscriptions which can affect our component 
    - Use effect allows us to perform side effects in function components and show changes
