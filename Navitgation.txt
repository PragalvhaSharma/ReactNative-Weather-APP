Navigation
    - If the user clicks on a link or a button to navigate onto a new page, that url gets pushed onto the stack 
    - When going back the old page gets popped off 
    - We need to use a navigator to move across different screens 
    - React native has no built in navigation so you need to use a library to add navigation to app 
        - The two most popular libraries are React Navigation(built in with expo) and React Native Navigation
        - They have the same goal but different implemenation
