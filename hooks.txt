Hooks in React are special functions that allow you to use features like state and lifecycle methods in function components. Here are two main ones:
- Special functions containing reusable logic 
- useState: Lets you keep track of a value that can change.
- useEffect: Lets you run code that has side effects.
        - We can pass in a dependency array which lets us specify what data when changed triggers a re-render

- Every hook starts with use
- Rules == 
     You can only call hooks from inside react functions.
     Must be called at the top level of a component before the return keyword is used.
